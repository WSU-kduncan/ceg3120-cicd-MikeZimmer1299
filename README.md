# Overview
## Purpose of the Repository
- Between the files in the main repo and within Project4 and Project5 folders, an Angular application creates a base website via Dockerfile. Project 4's purpose was to teach the basics of Docker Hub and GitHub Actions, and how updates for the website could be immediately built and pushed to the Docker Hub repo.
- Project 5 builds on top of the GitHub Action and Docker Hub repo uses, by creating a Webhook set up through Docker Hub and an AWS EC2 instance. Project 5 utilizes a bash script, Webhook definition, and Webhook service.
